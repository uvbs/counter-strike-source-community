## Attention

Due to the naturally of this port and the date of the leak code someone of the features of the CSS is missing such as de bots
and hostages and yes the Shield is missing in this pre-alpha but will ever fixed.

## Bugs

- If the player is too close to bomb's radius the game crash (you are warned)
- Closing the motd don’t bring the class selection screen. the only way to skip this limitation is opening the Dev console and type "joingame".
- The prop’s physics is a little... estranged... well sometimes you pass the entire prop but other times the prop push the player.
- The leaked scoreboard doesn’t work in the Source 2013 so the cheap way to fix this is using the SDK Template has placeholder until a fix is incoming.
- The round DONT end don't import if the time is 0:00 just the round doesn’t end.
- The flashbang doesn’t disappear sometimes.
- The Animation system used in the leak is the same in the HL2MP it used the base_playeranimstate so this animsystem don’t come whit a MP support so you can see the player making the walk anim but stuck at the first frame.
  The only way to fix this is redo the animation system to make work whit multiplayer_animstates.
- The lighting in the classmenu for the models is bugged don’t used the color white it used estranged colors.
- The Dynamic crosshair it’s not the same to the he original CSS someone of the cvars don’t work.
